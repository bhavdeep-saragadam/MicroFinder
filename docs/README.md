# Microfinder üî¨

> A mobile app empowering students and teachers to identify microbes through AI-powered microscope analysis

## üéØ Project Overview

Microfinder is a cross-platform mobile application that leverages **GPT-4 Vision** to help students and teachers identify microorganisms (viruses, bacteria, etc.) through their device's camera. The app provides:

- üì∏ Real-time microbe identification through microscope integration
- üéì Educational flashcards with detailed microorganism information
- üéÆ Interactive quizzes for learning reinforcement
- üìö Personal library of saved discoveries
